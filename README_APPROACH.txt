Hello there.

Ok this assignment was pretty tough for me. I literally spent the whole
day stuck on a problem that I just couldn't solve. I was able to create
the graphic image with custom text. When it came to sharing I had 
multiple options. Expo's sharing library, react-native's sharing library
and react-native-share sharing library.

After long trial and error and countless retries I realized expo's 
library couldn't capture elements and it could only share text. Same
goes for react-native library. Then react-native-share came to my 
rescue, but it was short lived as it doesn't work with expo. Now I 
don't know how to develop app on my local environment without expo.

So here I am now on a roadblock and I don't have much time left. Well 
writing this is definitely the highlight of my day today.

To whoever who reads this, this assignment was most definitely not fun.
But it made me learn a thing or two, which is what matters.
